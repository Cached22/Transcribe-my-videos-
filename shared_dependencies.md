Since the task is to create a README file for a project, typically, there are no direct dependencies like exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, or function names within the README.md file itself. The README.md is a standalone document that provides information about the project, such as:

- Project Title
- Description
- Installation Instructions
- Usage Instructions
- Contributing Guidelines
- License Information
- Contact Information for the Author or Maintainer

However, the content of the README.md may reference various aspects of the project it documents, such as:

- Names of the main scripts or executables
- Names of the key functions or classes if the project is a library
- Names of the main components if the project is an application
- Names of the environment variables that need to be set
- Names of the configuration files
- Names of the key dependencies or libraries used in the project

These references are not shared dependencies in the traditional sense used within the codebase, but rather informational pointers that help users understand and interact with the project.

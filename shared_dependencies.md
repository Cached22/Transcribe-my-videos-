As an AI, I don't have the capability to review repositories or access external content. However, I can guide you on how to write a program that would generate a step-by-step installation tutorial based on a repository's content. 

To generate such a program, you would need to consider the following shared dependencies that might be present in the files you are generating:

1. **Exported Variables:**
   - `installationSteps`: An array of strings detailing each step.
   - `dependenciesList`: An array of dependencies required for the installation.

2. **Data Schemas:**
   - `TutorialSchema`: An object structure that defines the properties of a tutorial, such as title, steps, and notes.
   - `DependencySchema`: An object structure that defines the properties of a dependency, such as name, version, and download link.

3. **ID Names of DOM Elements:**
   - `#installationGuideContainer`: The container element where the tutorial will be displayed.
   - `#stepTemplate`: The template element for a single step in the installation process.
   - `#dependencyList`: The element that lists all the dependencies.

4. **Message Names:**
   - `INSTALLATION_STEP_ADDED`: A message/event name indicating a new step has been added to the tutorial.
   - `DEPENDENCY_FETCH_ERROR`: A message/event name indicating there was an error fetching the dependency information.

5. **Function Names:**
   - `fetchRepositoryDetails()`: A function to fetch and parse the repository details.
   - `generateInstallationSteps()`: A function to generate the installation steps based on the repository content.
   - `displayTutorial()`: A function to display the generated tutorial on the webpage.
   - `listDependencies()`: A function to list all the dependencies required for the installation.

Please note that these are hypothetical names for shared dependencies that a program might use to generate a step-by-step installation tutorial. The actual names would depend on the specific implementation details of the program you are developing.

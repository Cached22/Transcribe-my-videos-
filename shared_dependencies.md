### Shared Dependencies

- **Variables**:
  - `folder_to_watch`: The path to the folder being monitored for new video files.
  - `file_path`: The path to the current video file being processed.

- **Data Schemas**:
  - `AudioData`: Represents the extracted audio data from a video file.
  - `SpeakerData`: Represents the speaker diarization information, including speaker IDs and timestamps.
  - `TranscriptionData`: Represents the transcription text along with speaker IDs.

- **Function Names**:
  - `extract_audio(file_path)`: Function to extract audio from a video file.
  - `diarize_audio(audio)`: Function to perform speaker diarization on the extracted audio.
  - `transcribe_audio(audio, speakers)`: Function to transcribe the audio using speaker diarization data.
  - `save_transcription(transcriptions, filename)`: Function to save the transcription to a file.
  - `generate_file_name(file_path)`: Function to generate a filename for the transcription text file.
  - `process_video_file(file_path)`: Main function to process a video file through all steps.
  - `main()`: Entry point of the application.

- **Configurations**:
  - `settings.py`: May contain shared configuration settings like paths, API keys, and thresholds for processing.

- **Log Files**:
  - `processing.log`: A log file to track processed files and any issues encountered.

- **User Interface Elements (if using a GUI framework)**:
  - `interface.py`: May contain shared UI elements like buttons, labels, and input fields with specific `id` names for DOM elements.

- **Directories**:
  - `transcripts/`: Directory where the final transcription files will be saved.
  - `watched_folder/`: Directory that the application will monitor for new video files.

- **External Libraries**:
  - `watchdog`: For monitoring folder changes.
  - `moviepy`: To extract audio from video files.
  - `diarization_library`: Placeholder name for whichever speaker diarization library is chosen (e.g., pyAudioAnalysis, pyannote.audio).
  - `whisper`: For audio transcription, if using OpenAI's Whisper.

- **Message Names**:
  - Not explicitly mentioned, but if the application uses a messaging system, there might be messages like `NewVideoFileDetected`, `AudioExtractionComplete`, `DiarizationComplete`, `TranscriptionComplete`, etc.

Please note that the actual implementation may require more or different shared dependencies based on the specific libraries and frameworks used, as well as the detailed design of the application.
